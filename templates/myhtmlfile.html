<h1>pdf.from_file two important notes </h1>
<p>If your file is from an external file source, a full path must be included in the html file</p>
<p>For example, when you an image with src css, src='file:///C://' should be included not just the image file name alone </p>
<b>ALSO, very important, don't include width and height in css for an image, it won't be loaded by wkhtmltopdf. </b>
